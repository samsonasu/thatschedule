The Chicago Chapter was started by Ali Karbassi in March 2013; the chapter has grown with the help of many volunteers from around the Chicago area.\r\n \r\n The main CoderDojo organization is a not-for-profit organization founded by James Whelton and Bill Liao. It was first started in early 2011 when Whelton hacked the iPod Nano and his younger students expressed an interest in learning how to code. He set up a computer club in his school (PBC Cork) and taught basic HTML and CSS. Later that year he and Bill Liao expanded CoderDojo beyond the after-school computer club.\r\n \r\n A second Dojo was launched soon after in nearby Dublin. The increasing success led to more Dojos in Ireland and around the world that are set up and run entirely by volunteers. Currently, there are nearly 200 Dojos in 24 countries. For a complete list of Dojos and more information on the project, visit CoderDojo.com.\r\n \r\n About the speaker: Ali Karbassi, the founder of CoderDojoChi, is a Senior Interactive Developer and Architect, Ali strives to combine multiple aspects of life to produce new meaning and push limits both physical and technical in his work. He has worked in many different programming and technology fields in the past fifteen years.

Just as there are levels of Maslow's Hierarchy that end in self actualization and enlightenment, there are layers of software delivery practice capability that similarly lead to organizational actualization. \r\n\r\nOrganizational actualization you say? That sounds pretty audacious. What does that really mean? \r\n\r\nIn Layer 1, we cover engineering practices. TDD, Functional Programming, and Clean Code live here. In order to sustainably do agile software development, you need clean code that is amenable to change. In the first part of the talk, I will cover developments that have occurred in the last 5 years or so that make simply \"do TDD\" not the only answer to this question. \r\n\r\nIn Layer 2, we cover agile and friends. Agile has, to some degree, gone mainstream. We will quickly cover how agile itself has evolved - and in some cases - devolved. We will also cover more recent developments that do things like end the \"tyranny of the iteration\", enable hyper distributed development (not just offshore, but work from home/work from chosen vacation destination), and reduce \"agile meeting overload\". \r\n\r\nIn Layer 3, we will cover Continuous Delivery and the DevOps movement. We will focus on what is meaningful for developers here, specifically around the notion of ubiquitous disposable infrastructure, the end of \"snowflake servers\", what \"phoenix deployment\" means, and more generally, why Continuous Delivery has been the ticket to a meeting with the CEO to discuss \"how do we enable this\" for the last five years. \r\n\r\nIn Layer 4, we will cover Lean Startup - and it's adaptation to larger organizations, Lean Enterprise. How do you wrap all this up in a manner that puts developers in a position such that they can write code in the morning, and see business results from that code in the afternoon? \r\n\r\nAt the end of this talk, you will have a deeper understanding of not just what these practices are, but why they are important, and more importantly, how they are connected and build on one another. You will be in a better position to help your organization understand the connection between writing clean code and enabling software to drive positive business change.","Category":"Other","Level":"200","ScheduledDateTime":"2015-08-10T10:30:00","ScheduledRoom":"G","IsFamilyApproved":false,"IsUserFavorite":null,"Accepted":true,"Canceled":false,"Speakers":[{"FirstName":"Aaron","LastName":"Erickson","HeadShot":"/cloud/profilephotos/Aaron-Erickson-0ad3496d-8dff-4f90-85d2-4c0678d0dcaa-635675787679160024.png","UserName":"aaron.c.erickson","Biography":"Aaron Erickson is a technology writer, software developer, and consultant at ThoughtWorks.

Maybe it showcases some products. Maybe it has blog posts, or videos, or other content. Or maybe it’s all of those things.\r\n\r\nYou know that the modern paradigm for finding information is search. Users much prefer to search for information from a text box than to browse for it. You want your users to have this power of search on your web site. How do you achieve this?\r\n\r\nEnter Elasticsearch: A simple-to-setup and simple-to-use search service. You simply feed it the information you want to be searchable using its index APIs and use its simple-yet-powerful search APIs to let users search for this information in milliseconds.\r\n\r\nElasticsearch is an open source horizontally-scalable, distributed search and analytics engine based on Apache Lucene. Elasticsearch is one of the most popular projects on Github with ~400 contributors, 3,000+ forks and 10,000+ commits. Organizations around the world, from startups to governments to large corporations, are using Elasticsearch for numerous use cases to gain real-time insights from large volumes of data.\r\n\r\nThis talk will introduce you to Elasticsearch in a conceptual and hands-on, practical way. We will talk about clusters, documents, indices, types, shards, and nodes. But we will also see each of these concepts in action via live demos. We will feed actual information into the Elasticsearch service and later retrieve it by searching for it!

Many companies today are making use of IoT technologies to save millions by understanding the data that comes from these devices, data that comes from sensors.\r\n\r\nIn this session, we'll look at a range of sensor types, from simple temperature sensors, to more complex sensors such as accelerometers. You'll see the kinds of data these sensors provide, and what they can be useful for. Then we'll look at different ways to communicate that data to internet-based services, whether through \"gateway\" devices, or directly from the device connected to the sensor. We'll discuss advantages and disadvantages of these architectural choices, including impact on security. Finally, we'll show an example of an end-to-end scenario of capturing sensor data and sending it off to Azure Event Bus, a service capable of ingesting and processing massive amounts of data from IoT devices.\r\n\r\nAdded bonus, thanks to the generosity of GHI Electronics, I have two new add-ons for Raspberry Pi 2 running Windows 10 IoT, so I will be demonstrating both the FEZ HAT, a Pi HAT loaded with sensors, lights, and motor controls, as well as the FEZ Cream, which brings the rapid prototyping of .NET Gadgeteer to Windows 10 IoT Core.","Category":"Other","Level":"200","ScheduledDateTime":"2015-08-10T10:30:00","ScheduledRoom":"C","IsFamilyApproved":false,"IsUserFavorite":null,"Accepted":true,"Canceled":false,"Speakers":[{"FirstName":"G.

Now your wrist can call people, and text people, and turn on the lights in your house while you're in Maui, and open your garage door, and your front door, and your car door, and your front car door, and... you get the picture.  Whatever your wrist app idea might be, this session will set you on the road to making it a reality.  We'll go over the WatchKit API and Apple Watch architecture, and show how easy it is to get an Apple Watch app up and running using Xamarin and C#.\r\n\r\nBut please when hiking do not gaze for too long at your beautiful new wrist app creation.

What are you actually selling your clients or your company when you are filling out the time detail of your week?\r\n\r\nWe all have a finite amount of time and can probably agree that it is one of the most precious things we possess. That said, it does not define who we are or what we make, it is simply a tangible aspect of the space in which we work. We lucky few are in the midst of a magical era during which we get to create reality out of imagination, yet we allow ourselves to be judged by the same techniques used to measure the efficiency of manufacturing gun powder and pig iron. To make matters worse, we allow these methods to not only drive us to unhealthy practices, but to define our very self-worth.\r\n\r\nThis talk is presented by a workaholic, who is slowly recovering and searching for a better way.

It is estimated that 90% of the stored data has been generated in just the last 5 years.  To put this in perspective, lets break it down a little.  Every minute, on average, YouTube users upload 48 hours of video, Facebook users share 684,478 pieces of content, Instagram users share 3,600 new photos, and Tumblr sees 27,778 new posts published.  The internet population now has over 2.1 billion people, and with every website browsed, status shared, and photo uploaded, we leave a digital trail that continually grows the hulking mass of big data.  Now that we have all of this data, what do we, as scientists do with it?

It’s no longer normal or acceptable for developers to sit and develop applications in isolation from the business. To that end, developers and business domain experts have been trying to find better ways to communicate. While developers tend to speak in terms of “code and technology” most business domain experts are more comfortable communicating in terms of scenarios, workflows and business rules.\r\n Test Driven Development (TDD) was the first step in getting these two groups to communicate in the same way. Developers could write unit tests that expressed business requirements with the hope that business users could validate that what was being tested was in fact what the desired behavior was. But, unit tests are still code and while it was better, the communication was still stilted and inefficient.\r\n\r\nTo help this communication new techniques such as Behavior Driven Development (BDD) and Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD) have become popular. Along with these new ideas, new tools like SpecFlow have become popular as a means to express unit tests in a way that the business can better understand and validate.\r\n\r\nThis session will demonstrate how SpecFlow can be leveraged in your BDD or ATDD practices. The Gherkin language and the “Given, When, Then” paradigm will be explained and you will see how to write tests in a way that business users are not only capable of reading, but can also help you create them.\r\n\"\r\n","Category":"Other","Level":"200","ScheduledDateTime":"2015-08-11T14:30:00","ScheduledRoom":"Tamarind","IsFamilyApproved":false,"IsUserFavorite":null,"Accepted":true,"Canceled":false,"Speakers":[{"FirstName":"James","LastName":"Bender","HeadShot":"/cloud/profilephotos/James-Bender-5f3b0ec9-cbe8-49ad-8e31-42bf9088907b.jpg","UserName":"JamesBender","Biography":"James is the Application Development Practice Lead for ICC and has been involved in software development and architecture for 18 years.

Frameworks such as Hood.ie have made offline-first apps their priority, handling all the details to allow users to use an app without interruption and without fearing data loss. Using a mobile app in a remote area shouldn't mean losing a lot of functionality. In this talk, we'll learn how we can leverage Estimote Beacons in an offline-first mobile app, searching for Bluetooth-enabled beacons in a mobile mashup of Letterboxing and micro-located Geocaching. We'll walk through building this type of mobile app and how it might be used to allow a user to collect Beacon-indicated treasure in an outdoor scavenger hunt all while remaining offline, only registering the user and his or her 'finds' once back online.

Not to mention getting to the end of a long day and thinking, \"Did I shower today?\", as you pass out in bed. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this session is to discuss some of the lessons I have learned over my years of working remotely. Talk about the rules I try to stick to in order to make not only working from home easier, but to keep some balance with your family and be okay with taking some time for yourself.

Some specific topics include:\r\n\r\n* How we wrote, ran, and ultimately moved away from a totally custom web server, the Braintree proxy or \"Broxy\".\r\n* Our techniques for safely performing schema changes and long-running data migrations on our Postgres clusters.\r\n* How we keep our applications healthy and responsive in a complex service-oriented architecture.\r\n* A few specific examples of mistakes we made and our learnings from them.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the talk, you'll have a thorough understanding of how highly available services are built, scaled and changed over time, and pick up a few tricks for keeping things up and running at your job.","Category":"Web","Level":"300","ScheduledDateTime":"2015-08-12T14:30:00","ScheduledRoom":"Tamarind","IsFamilyApproved":false,"IsUserFavorite":null,"Accepted":true,"Canceled":false,"Speakers":[{"FirstName":"Lionel","LastName":"Barrow","HeadShot":"/cloud/profilephotos/Lionel-Barrow-d6c8a205-9b53-4e3f-8b93-f5f2270b5791-635676911579201237.png","UserName":"lionelbarrow","Biography":"Lionel is a developer at Braintree and graduate student at the University of Chicago.
